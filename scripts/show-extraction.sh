# Why this is the right way to answer "what did the job actually read":
# History deliberately stores hashes and origins, never input text, and the
# run-phase draft bar keeps it only in the submitting tab. So after a refresh,
# or for anything submitted by email, there is no read path to the extracted
# text. Extraction is deterministic for the same bytes and the same pinned
# extractor, so running the file back through this endpoint reproduces exactly
# what the job used.
#
# Nothing is persisted by this call. It is a preview endpoint.
