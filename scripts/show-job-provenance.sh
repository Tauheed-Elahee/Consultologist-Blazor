#
# Read-only: one GET per job. It starts nothing, costs nothing, and changes
# nothing.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The provenance record is durable and has always been
# readable — it lives on the job's durable entity, GET
# /api/ConsultGenerationJobs/{id} serves it, and History renders it as the
# Provenance panel. What was missing was a way to reach it from a terminal.
#
# During #294's verification that gap cost several rounds: the events table
# was reachable from the CLI and empty, so it looked like nothing had been
# recorded. ConsultGenerationJobEvents is written only by the SSE endpoint —
# it is browser-resume data, not an audit trail — and a job nobody streamed
# correctly has no rows. The answer was on the job's own History page the
# whole time.
#
# WHAT TO READ IT FOR. "Which documents did this consult read?" An input with
# an origin was read from a file. An input with NO origin was not: it came
# from typed text or an email body, or it never arrived at all. That absence
# is the signal every defect in Milestone 16 turned on — #290, #291 and #294
# were each diagnosed from exactly this.
