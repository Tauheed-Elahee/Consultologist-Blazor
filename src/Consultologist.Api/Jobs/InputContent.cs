/// Whether a required input actually carries a referral (#290).
///
/// On 2026-08-04 a message arrived with the referral attached through
/// OneDrive. Outlook put it in the body as a **link**, Graph never listed it
/// as an attachment, and <c>consult_draft</c> was filled from the body — a
/// URL. The engine then generated a complete, well-formed oncology consult
/// in which every section read "not documented", and emailed it out as two
/// encrypted PDFs. Nothing signalled that the referral was missing.
///
/// <see cref="ConsultGenerationJobStarter.ResolveEffectiveInputs"/> already
/// requires declared inputs to be present and non-whitespace. That was
/// satisfied: the body was present and was not whitespace. Presence is not
/// content.
///
/// **The rule is deliberately about prose, not length.** A genuinely terse
/// referral is legitimate and must generate:
///
/// <code>
/// 65M, newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the lung, stage IIIA,
/// for consideration of chemoradiation. PMHx HTN.
/// </code>
///
/// That is ~95 characters once whitespace is removed. A SharePoint URL is
/// *longer* than that, so raw length cannot separate them — which is why
/// URLs come out before anything is counted. The failing body reduces to
/// nothing; the referral above is untouched.
///
/// **A known limit, stated rather than solved.** A signature block is prose
/// and counts, so a body carrying only a link and "Regards, Dr X, Oncology"
/// can still clear the floor. This is a floor, not a content check — it
/// catches the blatant case, and #290 records the rest.
