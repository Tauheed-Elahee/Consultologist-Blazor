# Content Repos: Workflows and Agents as GitOps-Published Artifacts

Design recorded 2026-07-10 (user-approved direction; implementation tracked on the
Configurable Workflow board, paired with milestone 2). Goal: the app repo becomes
**engine-only** — all content ships from dedicated repos through CI to the registry,
and content cadence fully decouples from app deploys.

## Topology: two repos

| Repo | Contents | Versioning / tags | Publishes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `consultologist-workflows` | Workflow package sources (today: `packages/general/`) | CalVer `vYYYY.MM.N` per package | `workflow-packages` blob container (`{name}/{version}/…` + `latest.json` pointers) |
| `consultologist-agents` | Agent manifests (today: `agents/test-json.yaml`) | Tags matching Foundry integer versions (`test-json/48`) | **Both** the Foundry agent version (via the agents REST API) and the manifest mirror in blob (`agents/{name}/{version}/agent.yaml`) |

Two repos rather than one content repo: clean per-artifact tagging (CalVer vs Foundry
integers), separate future access control (clinicians author workflows, not agents), and
consistency with the per-artifact repo pattern (`snomed-snowstorm-mcp`).

## Full GitOps for agents

Merging to the agents repo's main **is** the publish event: CI creates the new Foundry
agent version (`az rest POST …/agents/{name}/versions`) and mirrors the manifest to
blob. The portal is never used to publish, so git↔Foundry drift becomes impossible by
construction; the app's attestation check remains as the backstop that *proves* it
(catching out-of-band portal edits). The pin bump (`AzureAI__AgentVersion`) stays a
deliberate, separate act — publishing a version and activating it are different
decisions.

## Trust model (the load-bearing part)

The registry is only a git-controlled channel if **CI is the only writer**:

- CI authenticates via **GitHub→Azure OIDC federated credentials** (no stored secrets);
  its identity holds Storage Blob Data Contributor scoped to the registry containers,
  and (agents repo) the Foundry role needed to publish agent versions.
- Humans and the app hold **Storage Blob Data Reader** only. The current
  laptop-publishing flow (user's Contributor role on `consultologistjobqueue`) is
  retired at migration.
- Shared-key access on the storage account is disabled once nothing depends on it
  (overlaps with the identity-based-connections migration, issue #10).

With that in place, startup attestation compares the Foundry plane (portal-editable)
against the registry plane (git-only) — a meaningful cross-channel check. Serving the
attestation manifest from a registry that humans could write would make the check
tautological; the write restriction is what preserves its value. Rationale history: the
manifest was first bundled into the app package precisely to keep it in a
harder-to-change channel than the thing it verifies.

## App changes at migration

- `AgentAttestationService` fetches the manifest from the registry
  (`agents/{name}/{pinned-version}/agent.yaml`) instead of the bundled file; the bundled
  file remains only as a local-dev fallback. Enforce/warn semantics unchanged.
- The `specVersion` gate, trust policy (registry location, enforce mode), and the engine
  itself stay in the app repo — expectations about *how to interpret* content ride with
  the code.
- `scripts/publish-workflow-package.sh` migrates to the workflows repo (CI becomes its
  main caller); the app repo's `packages/` and `agents/` folders are removed.

## Migration checklist (for the implementing session)

1. Create `consultologist-workflows` and `consultologist-agents` (gh), seed from the app
   repo's `packages/` and `agents/` (short history — plain copy with a pointer commit is
   acceptable; `git filter-repo` if history preservation is wanted).
2. Entra: one app registration or user-assigned MI per repo CI with federated credentials
   for `repo:Tauheed-Elahee/<repo>:ref:refs/heads/main` (and tags); role assignments as
   above.
3. CI workflows: validate (schema, CalVer format, immutability check) → publish on tag
   (workflows) / on merge (agents, plus Foundry publish).
4. App: attestation registry fetch + remove bundled content; update
   `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` for any new settings (e.g. manifest registry URI).
5. Lock down: revoke laptop Contributor, disable shared-key access (with #10).
6. Update this doc's status line and `workflow-packages.md`'s authoring section.
