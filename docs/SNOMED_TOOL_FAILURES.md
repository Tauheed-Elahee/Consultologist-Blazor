# SNOMED Tool Failures in Consult Generation

Diagnosis and remediation options for consult-generation job failures caused by the
`search_concepts` SNOMED tool, investigated 2026-07-06.

> **Status (2026-07-09): root cause fixed; defense-in-depth added.**
> **Option 1 — done.** The MCP server was rewritten on .NET 10 with input validation and
> redeployed. Verified live: an over-length term now returns `{"error": "Search term
> must be 3 to 250 characters; use a single short clinical term (a few words), not a
> sentence."}` instead of the masked exception, so agents can self-correct.
> **Option 3 — done** (both parts, implemented in this repo on 2026-07-09; see
> "Option 3 in detail" below).
> **Option 2 — done** (2026-07-09): the tool-usage instruction was added to agent
> `test-json`, published as version 45, and `AzureAI__AgentVersion` on
> `canada-east-ai-function` was updated from 44 to 45 (the app pins the version, so the
> instruction was inert until the setting bump).
>
> A fourth layer exists in the MCP server itself: the `search_concepts` tool metadata
> (parameter description) states the 3–250-character short-term rule, which every tool
> consumer sees at call-forming time. Defense stack by reach: tool metadata (all MCP
> consumers) → agent instructions (all `test-json` callers) → repo prompt guidance
> (this repo's calls) → server-side validation (hard backstop).

## Symptom

Durable consult-generation jobs fail during preprocessing with:

```
Task 'ExtractPatientConceptsActivity' (#3) failed with an unhandled exception:
HTTP 400 (invalid_request_error: tool_user_error)
An error occurred invoking 'search_concepts': An error occurred invoking 'search_concepts'.
```

## Root cause (verified end-to-end)

1. **Snowstorm rejects long search terms.** Its REST API returns HTTP 400 with
   `"Search term can not have more than 250 characters."` — confirmed directly against
   `https://snomed.consultologist.ai/snowstorm/MAIN/concepts`.
2. **The MCP server does not handle that.** The `search_concepts` tool (Azure Functions
   MCP app at `mcp.snomed.consultologist.ai`) passes the agent's term straight through to
   Snowstorm with no length validation or error handling. When Snowstorm returns 400, the
   tool handler throws, and the MCP SDK masks the exception as the generic
   `An error occurred invoking 'search_concepts'.` Reproduced live: a ~200-character term
   returns results; a ~260-character term returns the masked error.
3. **Azure AI Foundry surfaces the tool failure as `tool_user_error`** (HTTP 400), which
   `AgentSectionGenerator` receives, failing `ExtractPatientConceptsActivity` and with it
   the orchestration.

The trigger is the agent occasionally passing a whole clinical phrase or sentence as the
search term instead of a short concept — anything over 250 characters kills the run. The
Snowstorm server itself is healthy; short searches work fine. Nothing in this repository
is broken.

## Involved Azure resources

Discovered 2026-07-07 via `az` while diagnosing this failure.

### MCP server: `consultologist-snomed-mcp-flex`

Updated 2026-07-09 after the .NET 10 migration; the original notes from 2026-07-07
described the retired predecessor app `consultologist-snomed-mcp` (.NET 9, hardcoded
Snowstorm URL, source not located at the time).

- Source repo: `../snomed-snowstorm-mcp/` (sibling of this repo;
  `snomed-snowstorm-mcp.csproj`, `SnowstormFunctions.cs`).
- Azure Functions app `consultologist-snomed-mcp-flex`, resource group `snomed-rg`
  (Flex Consumption; replaced the deleted `consultologist-snomed-mcp`). Targets
  `net10.0`, isolated worker, `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Mcp`.
- Still serves `mcp.snomed.consultologist.ai`.
- Revised toolset: `SearchConcepts` (now with optional semantic-tag filter),
  `ValidateConcept`, `GetConcept`, `GetParents`, `GetAncestors`, `GetChildren`,
  `GetTerminologyInfo`, `EclQuery`; `GetBySemanticTag` was dropped.
- The Snowstorm base URL now comes from the `SNOWSTORM_URL` app setting (no longer
  hardcoded), and tool handlers guard against non-JSON Snowstorm responses and
  unreachable-server errors, returning `{error: ...}` payloads instead of throwing.
- **The fix-option-1 guard is implemented and verified live (2026-07-09):**
  `SearchConcepts` rejects terms outside 3–250 characters with a descriptive,
  agent-correctable error; in-range searches behave as before. The other tools carry
  equivalent guards (also verified live): SCTID shape validation on the concept-ID
  tools, non-empty ECL and 1–10000 limit checks, and Snowstorm's own error messages
  passed through instead of masked exceptions. The last residual gap — timeouts
  (`TaskCanceledException`) escaping as masked exceptions — was closed on 2026-07-09
  (commit `0fff939` in the MCP repo): all network catch sites handle timeouts alongside
  connection failures. Option 1 is fully implemented.
- Two consumers: the Foundry agent below (consult generation), and the developer's
  Claude Code MCP config (`snowstorm-azure`).

### Foundry agent

- Agent **`test-json`**, version **45** (as configured on 2026-07-09; version 45 added
  the SNOMED tool-usage instruction), in Foundry project `consultologist-canada-east`.
- Backing Azure resource: `consultologist-canada-east-resou` (kind AIServices), resource
  group `consultologist_group`. Manage the agent (instructions, model, MCP tool wiring)
  in the Azure AI Foundry portal (ai.azure.com), not the classic Azure portal.
- The consuming Function App `canada-east-ai-function` selects the agent via app settings
  `AzureAI__AgentName` / `AzureAI__AgentVersion` / `AzureAI__Endpoint`. That app also
  carries stale `AzureAI__*__old` settings (old assistants-era agent id, endpoint, and
  API version) that the code no longer reads — cleanup candidates.

## Fix options

In order of value:

1. **The MCP server (root fix).** Applied in the `consultologist-snomed-mcp` Functions
   app (see resources above; source is not in this repo): validate the term and
   return an *informative* tool error instead of throwing — e.g., "Search term must be
   250 characters or fewer; retry with a short clinical term." Agents can self-correct
   from a descriptive error; they cannot from a masked exception. Alternatively, truncate
   to 250 characters and proceed, though the explicit error usually produces better agent
   behavior. The same input guard belongs on the other tools (`get_ancestors`,
   `get_children`, `validate_concept`, `ecl_query`).
2. **The Foundry agent's instructions.** Add a line to the agent definition that
   `search_concepts` must be called with short terms — single clinical concepts, a few
   words — never sentences.
3. **This repository (mitigation).** Prompt guidance plus Durable retry policies in
   `src/Consultologist.Api/Jobs/ConsultGenerationJobs.cs` — detailed below.

## Option 3 in detail

> Implemented 2026-07-09. Part A: the tool-usage guidance is prepended in
> `ConsultGenerationPreprocessingRunner.RunConceptPromptAsync`. Part B:
> `ConsultGenerationOrchestrator.AgentActivityRetryOptions` (3 attempts, 5 s first
> retry, 2× backoff, `HandleFailure` excludes `InvalidOperationException`) is passed at
> all seven agent activity call sites. Note the isolated-worker API detail: the failure
> filter is set via `RetryPolicy.HandleFailure` (the `Handle` property is read-only).

Two independent changes in `ConsultGenerationJobs.cs`, both defensive — they reduce how
often the bad tool call happens and stop it from killing the whole job when it does.

### Part A — tool-usage guidance in the prompts (prevention)

The four preprocessing activities (`ExtractPatientConceptsActivity`,
`IdentifyProblemActivity`, `CreateTypicalTrajectoryActivity`,
`CreatePatientTrajectoryActivity`) each build a prompt and funnel it through
`ConsultGenerationPreprocessingRunner.RunConceptPromptAsync`. Add one instruction there —
prepended once, so all four get it:

> When calling SNOMED tools such as `search_concepts`, search for one short clinical term
> at a time (a few words); never pass sentences or text over 250 characters.

Prompt steering is not a guarantee, but it directly targets the observed failure mode,
and it is the only lever this repo has over the agent's tool-calling behavior since the
agent definition lives in Foundry.

### Part B — Durable retry policy on the activity calls (resilience)

The orchestrator invokes every activity bare — no `TaskOptions` — so a single thrown
exception fails that step and cascades into the job-failure path immediately. Call sites:
the four concept activities and the three section-drafting activities
(`context.CallActivityAsync(...)` around lines 1418–1508 and 1710–1738).

The change: define one shared `TaskOptions` with a `RetryPolicy` (e.g., 3 attempts, ~5 s
first retry, 2× backoff) and pass it at those call sites. This is unusually effective
here because agent calls are nondeterministic: a retry re-runs the same prompt, and the
agent almost certainly issues different tool calls the second time, so one over-length
`search_concepts` call stops being fatal.

Refinement worth including: use `TaskOptions.FromRetryHandler` to retry only on the
retryable signature (the HTTP 400 `tool_user_error` / transient failures) so genuine
configuration errors — like the missing-`AzureAI__Endpoint` `InvalidOperationException`
from `AgentSectionGenerator` — still fail fast instead of burning three agent calls.

### Trade-offs

- Retries cost extra Foundry tokens and add latency when a step does fail.
- Part A makes every run's prompts slightly longer.
- Existing failure handling is undisturbed: the orchestrator's failure-text
  categorization only engages after retries are exhausted, so the user-facing
  "concept extraction failed" path remains the final backstop.

### Scope and verification

Roughly 15–20 lines, all in `ConsultGenerationJobs.cs`. Verify by building, running the
test suite, and exercising a consult generation end-to-end.

Option 3 is mitigation, not the cure — the root fix remains the 250-character guard with
a descriptive error in the MCP server, because a masked exception leaves any agent
(including future ones) unable to self-correct.
